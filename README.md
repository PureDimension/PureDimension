- Hello friends! My name is PureDimension, but I also go by the pen name “涟漪Rippin,” which comes from the word “ripple.”
- I’m new to the GitHub open-source community and am trying to expand my tech stack and develop my coding skills by contributing to open-source projects.
- Currently, I’m a graduate student at Nanjing University, focusing on AI-related research.
- Beyond coding, I have many personal goals, such as learning music composition, creating indie games, learn pixel art and Japanese. I aspire to become a freelancer(though that’s quite unrealistic in China) and hope that one day I will have the skills to do so!
- For Chinese users: 我的一个更加*电波系、白日梦和碎碎念*的中文网站在https://void-island-site.vercel.app/
- Feel free to connect and make friends!!!(｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡
